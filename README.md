# CPP MODULES

My 10th project at 42 Network's Hive Helsinki 🐝

Introductions from C to C++

> [!TIP]
> If you're at a 42 school and doing this project: It's genuinely so much better to ask fellow students instead of reading online solutions ✨

## Description

This project's about introducing us to C++ through modules focused on different aspects:
- `module00`: Classes, member functions, stdio streams, initialization lists, static members, some other basic stuff
- `module01`: Memory allocation, pointers to members, references, switch statements (switches were forbidden in our C projects)
- `module02`: Ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading, Orthodox Canonical class form
- `module03`: Inheritance
- `module04`: Subtype polymorphism, abstract classes, interfaces

## Usage

> [!NOTE]
> Code was written and tested for Linux (using Hive's Ubuntu iMacs)

- Go into an exercise (`module0*/ex0*`) directory of your choice
- Compile by running `make` (or `make color` in select exercises!)
- Run `./[PROGRAM]`
